# Hello World!


# Introduction

Hello! This is my first github upload as part of a class assignment. I
have come across github in many other situations in the past and am glad
for an opportunity to finally familiarize myself with it.

## Approach

I plan to investigate the New York City Restaurant Inspection Results
data from NYC OpenData. I love trying new restaurants in the city and am
adamant that the places we go to pass their health grades! I came across
this database last smester and glad to have an chance to explore it in
this course.

## Process

My planned process is as follows:

\(1\) Download the dataset and evaluate which columns I would like to
include for this project. (A brief glimpse suggests the borough, grade,
score, and maybe a few others)

\(2\) Figure out how to post the dataset on Github.

\(3\) Create quarto document with subset of data per assignment.

\(4\) Time permitting, work with gemini to explore data and create
visualizations as appropriate.

## Anticipated Challenges

I have not used Quarto and Github in the past so anticipate that could
be a challenge. If time permits, I would also like to sign up and
familiarize myself with publishing to rpubs.com.
